# SQL-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

In this project, I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis using Structured Query Language (SQL) to gain more insight and answer some technical questions surrounding Covid-19. 

Data source: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

Skills used: Data Selection from Tables, Joins, Aggregate Functions, Data Types Conversion, CTEs, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Creating Views. 

SQL queries are written to answer the following questions: 
  -- Total Cases vs Total Deaths?
  -- Chances of dying if you contract COVID-19 in your country?
  -- Total Cases vs Population?
  -- What percentage of the population was infected with Covid?
  -- Countries with the highest Infection Rate compared to Population?
  -- Countries with Highest Death Count per Population?
  -- Continents with the highest death count per population?
  -- Total Population vs Vaccinations
  -- Percentage of the population that has received at least one COVID-19 vaccine
